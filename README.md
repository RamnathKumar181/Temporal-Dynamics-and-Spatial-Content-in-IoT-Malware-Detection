This contains the source code for the paper "Temporal-Dynamics-and-Spatial-Content-in-IoT-Malware-Detection". 

The link to the paper is https://doi.org/10.1109/TENCON.2019.8929496

## Run

Clone the repository.
To run the model, you need to execute the following command:
```
python3 rnn.py
```
or
```
python3 tl.py
```
or
```
python3 cnn.py
```
This should allow your model to train on new examples. Or you could modify the code to predict for your own iot binaries.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- keras : <code> pip install keras </code>
- numpy : <code> pip install numpy </code>

## System Used
1. CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.30GHz
2. GPU: 1xTesla K80 , having 2496 CUDA cores, compute 3.7,  12GB(11.439GB Usable) GDDR5  VRAM
3. RAM: 12.6GB
