# Temporal-Dynamics-and-Spatial-Content-in-IoT-Malware-Detection

This contains the source code for the paper "Temporal-Dynamics-and-Spatial-Content-in-IoT-Malware-Detection".

## Getting Started

Clone the repository. The weights from our training will automatically be loaded into the model.
To run the model, you need to execute the following command:
```
python3 rnn.py
```
or
```
python3 tl.py
```
or
```
python3 cnn.py
```
This should allow your model to train on new examples. Or you could modify the code to predict for your own iot binaries.
# Psychological Counselling Information Retrieval

This application is designed to retrieve information about similar cases and episodes given the user (therapist) knows a few details about the patient. The information retrieved will be cases similar to the patient and can help the therapist treat him/her better and also help the therapist in how to go about new and uncertain cases. The therapist can also use this search engine if he/she would like to volunteer to help other patients who are in need and cannot afford a therapist.
