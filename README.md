# Temporal-Dynamics-and-Spatial-Content-in-IoT-Malware-Detection

This contains the source code for the paper I wrote "Temporal-Dynamics-and-Spatial-Content-in-IoT-Malware-Detection".
The paper is under review for the Tencon2019 and the codes cannot be made public.
The abstract of our paper is as follows:
The Internet Of Things(IoT) is an extension of the traditional Internet which allows a very large number of smart devices, such as home appliances, network cameras, sensors and controllers to connect to one another to share information and improve user experiences. Their increasing presence in a broad range of applications, along with their processing capabilities makes them a valuable attack target for IoT malware. In the recent years, machine learning has served as a useful resource for researchers in malware detection. There are two major technologies to detect malwares, but most organizations rely almost exclusively on just one approach, the decades old signature based methodology. Although, the signature based approach is very powerful against known threats, it is very weak against new ones. We present our initial work in building a solution to tackle this problem and introduce malware detection from raw byte-sequences as a fruitful research area to the larger machine learning community. In this work, we discuss the many challenges in building the neural network to process data at this scale, and the methods we used to work around them. These opportunities and challenges can serve as potential future research directions. The experimental results show that the proposed system can achieve 99.01% accuracy on classifying binaries as malware and benign.
The malware and benign binaries however have not been included in the repository for security reasons.
We have created 3 different models.
The RNN.py, CNN.py and TL.py
The CNN.py outperforms the other models and achieves an accuracy of 99.01%.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository. The weights from our training will automatically be loaded into the model.
To run the model, you need to execute the following command:
```
python3 rnn.py
```
or
```
python3 tl.py
```
or
```
python3 cnn.py
```
This should allow your model to train on new examples. Or you could modify the code to predict for your own iot binaries.

### Prerequisites

Our model needs some libraries installed before you will be able to run the program.

* Python3 or Python2
```
sudo apt-get install python3 
sudo apt-get install python2
```
* 

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
