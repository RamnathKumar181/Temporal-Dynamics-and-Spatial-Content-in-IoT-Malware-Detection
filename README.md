## Run

Clone the repository. The weights from our training will automatically be loaded into the model.
To run the model, you need to execute the following command:
```
python3 rnn.py
```
or
```
python3 tl.py
```
or
```
python3 cnn.py
```
This should allow your model to train on new examples. Or you could modify the code to predict for your own iot binaries.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6
- keras : <code> pip install keras </code>
- numpy : <code> pip install numpy </code>

## System Used
1. CPU: Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU @ 2.30GHz
2. GPU: 1xTesla K80 , having 2496 CUDA cores, compute 3.7,  12GB(11.439GB Usable) GDDR5  VRAM
3. RAM: 12.6GB
